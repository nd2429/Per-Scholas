thats my website link. 





I am not sure if I uploaded the folders or paths correctly.
i tried rewriting almost every possible variation i could think of for the paths for the css link
and for the nav links. 



i have uploaded a compressed zip file with all of my pages. 
[Per Scholas Softwear Engineering.zip](https://github.com/nd2429/nd2429Per-Scholas/files/9967687/Per.Scholas.Softwear.Engineering.zip)
these are my original codes that work fine on my computer. unfortunately github is not including my css. 



please advice.


thank you,
