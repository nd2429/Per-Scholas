        Now that you know a little about me. Let's dig in a little deeper about myself, hobbies and interests.
        In the past, my career was in the field of Psychology and I worked with people with developmental disabilities.
        Although I cared deeply
        about every case I had and knew I was making a difference, most of the time we were limited with what we were
        able to do for them. I went to school for Psychology and
        Counseling because I wanted to help people and make a difference in my idividudals' lives and in the field.
        Towards the end of finishing my second degree, I came to
        the realization that I cannot do what I went in with the intention of doing because of many factors that
        influence the field. This left me feeling upset and defeated.
        the epiphany then came to me. I wanted to be more independent and creative in my life and in my career.

        I wanted to expand my creativity that I was suppressing and while curiously doing research about my likes and
        dislikes, I came across coding and all
        the possibilities that come along with it.
        Therefore, I started to teach myself on my free time for fun. It was easy at fist until it wasn't. However, I
        love a challenge. During the lockdown for COVID-19 I found
        myself wanting to make a change in my life and pursue my purpose and find out what hobbies I would even like,
        since I never got a chance to explore them
        fully growing up.

            COVID-19 was a rough time and unfortunately I got laid off. Until I realized it was a blessing and a curse.
            I now had the chance to have all
            the free time to explore myself and make changes in my life that I didn't have time to do because, you know,
            adulting. Shortly after, reality kicked in and the
            anxiety about bills started bubbling up. My mother retired that same summer and gave me the opportunity to
            go after what I desired. I jumped right into brainstorming
            and researching everything. I started to think that my coding hobby could be something I could do as a
            career and gives me the ability to be creative. Not only could I
            do this for work, but also, keep it going on the side to practice, make my own projects and see how far I
            can allow my imagination to get me.
            After some research, I realized I wanted to go to a Software Engineering bootcamp and I found Per Scholas.
            To my delight I was accepted! I'm looking forward to where
            this journey takes me.

        <p id="para4">
            I didn't just stop there. I began doing research about my interest and hobbies. I realized that health is
            very important to me and I decided to come up with
            a plan to eat healty and get in shape. Not only for the aesthetics but also, becuase of the food that is
            produced for us is not very nutritious and somewhat
            questionable.
            However, I took it one step further. I decided I wanted to grow my own food to the highest of my ability and
            limitations.
            This is my first time gardening/growing, so I'm startimg slow. I really enjoy gardening now and find it
            therapeutic.

            Health is not just about eating and working out. Mental health is also very important and is what closes the
            holistic approach in every aspect of what is to be considered
            healthy. Your mental health can affect your physical health and vice versa. Stress, burn out, anxiety,
            depression and other factors can very much affect you mentally
            and physically. These symptoms are prevalent in almost any industry you work at or even at home. this can
            affect your productivity, health, emotions, amongst other things in
            every aspect of your life. This is why it is very important to stop and check in with yourself once in a
            while and assess how you're feeling phisically and mentally; along with
            being aware of what you're eating. Food also has an impact on physical and mental health. Check out the
            table below for some more information on what fruits, vegetables, herbs and
            spices you can grow or try to find organic at your local store.
